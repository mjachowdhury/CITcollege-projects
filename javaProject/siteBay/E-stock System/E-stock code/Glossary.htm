            forecasts for companies they follow. Sometimes analysts publish a 
            lower number than they really believe to reduce chances of a 
            negative surprise, but they supposedly "whisper" what they really 
            think to their best friends.&nbsp;Most whisper numbers you see on 
            the Web are simply the analysts' consensus forecasts plus the 
            average of the most recent two or three earnings 
            surprises.&nbsp;</FONT></P>

            For instance, if a bond pays $1.00 interest annually, and is selling 
            for $10.00, the yield is (1.00/10.00) 10 percent.</FONT>
