<tr><td colspan=3><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditional search engines are very useful tools for searching specific
information in World Wide Web (WWW). But they lack the ability to index
and hence search the dynamic content of the web, which is growing at a
much faster rate than the static content. The information stored in the
searchable databases of deep websites, which is around hundreds of times
more than the static content quantitatively and 3-4 times better qualitatively,
can only be searched by direct query to the database. But the process of
one at a time direct query to different deep websites is a time consuming
and laborious process.&nbsp; We have developed a search engine
that automates the process of sending queries to these  websites using
advanced technology and presents the search result from all the sites
to the user.</p></td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE>
