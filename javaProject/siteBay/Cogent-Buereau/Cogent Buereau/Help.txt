DataBase : Oracle 9i

create user distcol identified by distcol;
grant dba to distcol;
conn distcol/distcol
select * from tab;

Note:-
------
in this project we are using JdbcIV driver,

GlobalDataBaseName is 'orcl'. if we want to change this we have to change the logic in nearly 100 above files.

and it is having lot of errors.


its fully hardcoded project.
