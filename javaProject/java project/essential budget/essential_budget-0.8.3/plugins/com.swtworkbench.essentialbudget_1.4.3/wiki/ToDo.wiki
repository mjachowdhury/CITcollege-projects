      * Detail table refresh problems
   * Help | Definitions window to explain the terminology
   * File | Account Setup: Account/category/beginning balance setup wizard; explain how to use MROTable
   * Online help -- Explain how to use the table control, terminology definitions


---++ Bug fixes

   * Cross-platform
      * Scroll bar limits aren't always set correctly in MROTable
      * Resizing the MROTable messes up MROTable's idea of the current row
      * Make sure that Transactions re-sort properly when a date is changed
         * To be done properly, Essential Data needs new API to allow the developer to specify sort fields/constraints
   * Linux
      * When a field's value gets set (for example as a result of a master-detail refresh), the last field to receive a value winds up selected, even though the selection could be in a very different place from the focus.
