The Jakarta-ORO library follows the same build procedure as other
Jakarta projects, relying on the Ant build system.  You can learn more
about the Ant build system from http://jakarta.apache.org/.  If
you don't have Ant installed on your system, you must download and
install it to compile the software.

By default, build.xml will build a jar file containing the library.
Optionally, you can pass one of the following build targets as an
argument to Ant:
	 lib	      - builds the library
	 examples     - builds the example programs
	 examples-awk - builds the org.apache.oro.text.awk examples
	 tools        - builds the utility programs
	 jar          - builds a jar file containing the class library
	 javadocs     - builds the API documentation
	 package      - builds a source distribution package
	 package-zip  - builds a distribution package stored as a zip file
	 package-tgz  - builds a distribution package stored as a
			gzipped tar file (.tar.gz)
	 clean        - removes all files generated by build targets

All generated class files are stored in a classes/ directory.  All
documentation is stored in a doc/ directory.

Examples:
	To build only the library use:

	   ant lib

	To build only the javadocs use:

	   ant javadocs
